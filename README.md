to give powerups, some are placed on the grid

Powerups:
- battle ships on Steam power ups 
- Scan (with animation)
- Bomb remover
- Double coin
- Second life
- More bombs, more coins
- end game bonus minigame
- buy skins/themes
- easy mode
- endless mode
- candy crush map

MVC/PAC for system structure button for interaction and reveal with game logic why not use keyboard
